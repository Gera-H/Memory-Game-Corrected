**Catching Colors** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Gerardo Huerta**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://catching-colors--memory-game.glitch.me

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [check] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [check] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [check] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [check] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [check] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [check] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [check] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I did not use any outside resources aside from the ones provided by codepath. I mainly recalled from my previous introductory Computer Science classes.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I had difficulty filling up this file, and it is still confusing. For the GIF part, I ended up using ScreentoGif, and app that records my screen and converts video to GIF. 
I am trying to be as clear as possible.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing this web developemetn project, I am happy about the out come. Although code was provided, I enjoyed builing up this game, and cant wait to see what else I can create.
Also, I noticed that there is a lot of testing that needs to be made before the final outcome, because you never know what will be missing or what doesn't work properly.
My question is, how many hours of testing does a software engineer or web developer tend to invest into a project before achiving their final outcome? I would love to know,
and I will try my best during the SITE program.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had more time to work on this project I would had more buttons that will each represent a level and a pattern. What I mean by this, is that each level would be from easy to hard,
and along each level, each would have a random pattern genereated by the computer. This would make the game competitive and enjoyable when playing with friends. I would
also add a counter strike for the hard level, to give a second chance to the player.]
